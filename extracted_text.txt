--- CHAPTER 2 ---
hospital at New Babbage is really pretty fancy.</span><span class="p">They call it a “Care Center,” but I’m old and traditional in some ways, so I think of it as a hospital. Whatever. That’s where I came back to consciousness.</span><span class="p">Before I even opened my eyes, I heard the sounds of the place. The fans circulating filtered air hummed, and a machine off to my left was gently going “ping” every 10 seconds or so. When I opened my eyes, the low, bluish lighting still felt bright until my pupils adjusted.</span><span class="p">Look, I like science, I really do. But I have no training in high-level biology or regeneration or anything like that. So when I talk about “regenerating” a human being, I am talking only as a layman. What I understand about it is that I paid a bunch of credits to BiotiCorp, went to a facility where they put me in this sphere thing, it somehow scanned me – both body and mind, I guess – and then it stored the “imprint.” Then, through some sort of quantum entanglement feature, if I die, my imprint will be used to regenerate a new version of me, complete with all my memories up till the moment I died.</span><span class="p">–Basically, it’s magic to me.</span><span class="p">I don’t need to understand how it works, as long as it works. And, for a while, anyway, it does work. But eventually, the imprint gets too much “trauma” or something and starts to wear out. After some limited number of regenerations, it won’t work anymore. Then you’re just dead.</span><span class="p">I could still count on one hand the number of times I’d had to regenerate. But for me, at 64, time was getting shorter. –I should be clear: this is no fountain of youth. When you regenerate, you are the same age as when you died, not the age when you last recorded an imprint. So I was still 64, and my imprint was wearing out, they told me. Great.</span><span class="p">After I got up and got dressed, I went to the cafeteria and got some hot Earl Grey. As I sat dunking my tea bag, my mobiGlas buzzed. I popped up the holographic display and saw an incoming hail from Zero. I hit ACCEPT. I saw a simple hologram version of Zero looking subdued.</span><span class="p">“Hey, so how’s your day going?” I said. Zero didn’t respond. I knew him well enough to know that something like this had the potential to really get him down.</span><span class="p">“Oh, let’s not focus on the bad news here – so we lost our awesome ship, got killed, used up a regen, and we’re kind of hard up for money. Big deal! Right? Look at the bright side!” I said smiling, comically. I paused, still smiling broadly, eyebrows raised. I blinked a couple times.</span><span class="p">“What’s the bright side?” Zero asked.</span><span class="p">“Eh, I’m working on that part.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah.” He shook his head. “Have you heard from Salty yet? Did he regen? Was his IVS getting low?”</span><span class="p">I tried to keep a brave face. “I don’t think his score was that low. –I just got up and got some tea. I haven’t heard anything from him.” My heart sank a bit though. I would have expected Salty to get in touch. Could he not have a regen left?</span><span class="p">Zero frowned. It looked like he was still in a hospital gown, and the room behind him looked like the one where I had regenerated. “Where are you, Zero? I’m in the Brentwood cafeteria.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah, upstairs. I’ll come down in a minute.”</span><span class="p">“Cool. See you then.” I said and closed the connection.</span><span class="p">“We shoulda’ had that fuckin’ fish,” a voice behind me said.</span><span class="p">I stood up and turned around.</span><span class="p">“Yeah, you really pulled too hard there at the end,” I said, looking down at the ground.</span><span class="p">“No, no. It was clearly because you let go of the net, putting too much pressure on the line. I had been managing that thing fine for five minutes.”</span><span class="p">“I never said I knew what I was doing–”</span><span class="p">“Which is clearly true.”</span><span class="p">“It was your responsibility as the ‘master angler’ to tell me what to do.”</span><span class="p">“If I always took the time to tell you what to do, we’d never get anything done.”</span><span class="p">I looked up. Salty looked a little different somehow, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. My attempt to keep a straight face failed, and then Salty’s did too. He pointed to my tea. “Earl Grey?”</span><span class="p">“Mmhm.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah, I think I need something to drink.” I nodded, and he turned toward the beverage section. He returned with a yellow-green bottle of Cruz Lux and sat down. He twisted the cap open and took a long pull. Over his shoulder, I saw Zero approaching across the room. He saw us, and a warm smile crept gently onto his face. He walked up behind Salty and put a hand on his shoulder. Salty glanced up, smiled subtly, and patted Zero’s hand twice.</span><span class="p">“I think I’ll get a drink too,” Zero said. I nodded, and he walked over to the drinks.</span><span class="p">I opened my mobi and went to the finance section. It said my balance was just over 78,000 credits. We weren’t broke, but we didn’t have a ship. I looked to Salty. “You have any significant bank at this point?”</span><span class="p">He popped his mobiGlas open and said, “If you consider 7421 UEC significant.”</span><span class="p">Zero returned to the table with a cup of coffee.</span><span class="p">“Zero, how’s your bank situation?”</span><span class="p">“Bad.”</span><span class="p">“How bad is bad?”</span><span class="p">“I think I have just over 10k,” he said.</span><span class="p">“OK then. We have something close to 95k between us, I guess.”</span><span class="p">“All that shit we’d been putting on the ship,” Salty said darkly.</span><span class="p">As much as I wanted to make a joke, I knew we needed some time to grieve. “Yeah, it really sucks.”</span><span class="p">Zero was silent.</span><span class="p">“I mean, I do really hate that ship,” Salty said.</span><span class="p">“Yeah, I think when you named it <em>The Pig</em> we got the idea.”</span><span class="p">“It really flew like shit. It was slow and unmaneuverable. Like flying a house.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah.”</span><span class="p">We sat and sipped silently for a couple minutes.</span><span class="p">I broke the silence. “You guys think they tracked the ship to us?”</span><span class="p">“I’ve been thinking about it,” Zero said. “If they could have tracked it, why would they wait a half a year to come for it?”</span><span class="p">“Yup, it’s not like they needed to assemble a huge fuckin’ fleet or anything,” Salty said.</span><span class="p">“And it’s not like there weren’t other times when they could have caught us unprepared,” I added.</span><span class="p">“Maybe they couldn’t track it, so they had to track us down,” Zero said.</span><span class="p">“Seems likely to me,” I said. “Not that it matters now.”</span><span class="p">“Nope, it’s a fuckin’ memory.”</span><span class="p">“They sure knew where we were today, though,” I said.</span><span class="p">“They definitely did. They knew exactly where we were,” Zero said.</span><span class="p">“I’m pretty sure I know the answer to this, but I’ll ask anyway: it’s not worth trying to get that ship back, is it?”</span><span class="p">“Hell no,” Salty said.</span><span class="p">Zero was shaking his head.</span><span class="p">“And do you think that Nine Tails is done with us now, or do we still need to worry about them?”</span><span class="p">“As I was lying there, bleeding out,” Zero said. “I heard one of them say something about having taught us a good lesson. I don’t know how serious or literal that was, but it’s something.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah,” I said, “I think they probably count our debt paid: they took the ship and killed all three of us–”</span><span class="p">“Oh shit!” Salty cut in.</span><span class="p">Zero and I turned to him. “They killed us three, but what about Freight, Meeka and J?”</span><span class="p">“Oh shit,” I said. “Let’s check on them.”</span><span class="p">“Freight’s pretty gone now,” Zero said. “I mean, in theory, they could track him down on Terra, but that’s a long way to go.”</span><span class="p">Our good friend FreightTrainJim, who had been central to our escapade six months back, had been working at a medical facility in Pyro’s Ruin Station. But about four months ago, he met a woman, and they hit it off so well that they left Pyro for the Terra system, and they settled on Terra III recently. Meeka and J had both gone back to their jobs at Grim Hex. We were in touch with them now and then. J had even joined us on a couple bounty contracts, which was fun.</span><span class="p">“I feel like we should check in on J and Meeka at Grim, you know?” I said. “Why don’t we drop in on them?”</span><span class="p">“How would we do that without a ship?” Salty asked.</span><span class="p">“Oh man.” I guess I hadn’t absorbed the loss completely. I sighed. “Well, let’s just message them.”</span><span class="p">In short order, we heard from both J and Meeka, and they seemed safe enough. But we told them what had happened and warned them about Nine Tails. J was defiant: “Bring ‘em on! I’ll fillet each one slowly.”</span><span class="p">But Meeka was – not surprisingly – low key about it. “Mmm, I don’t think they’re coming for us.”</span><span class="p">“What makes you say that?” Salty asked.</span><span class="p">“I dunno. It just feels like they don’t care.”</span><span class="p">I knew Meeka and their empath ways well enough to know if it felt true to them, it was probably true.</span></p><p id="text21" class="text-component instance-21 style-7"><span class="p">CHAPTER 3 -----------</span><span class="p"><em>Bzzzt</em></span><span class="p">My

mobi vibrated on my wrist. Glancing at it, I got a pit in my stomach when I saw there was a video message from a woman with green hair.</span><span class="p">“What is it?” Salty asked.</span><span class="p">“Do you remember Lieutenant Anderson from the Nine Tails’ asteroid base where we rescued Freight?”</span><span class="p">“That hardass we couldn’t talk our way past? Green hair?”</span><span class="p">“Yeah. It’s a message from her.”</span><span class="p">We were still sitting at a table in the cafeteria at the hospital. “Let’s find a more private place to watch this,” I said. Zero and Salty nodded and we walked out of there into the lobby area.</span><span class="p">Zero pointed to the big window looking out on the frozen lake. “Let’s go over there. No one’s around.”</span><span class="p">We walked past the ASOP terminals where a couple guys in armor, carrying rifles were whispering to each other. I put my back to the window; Salty and Zero got on either side of me, and I called up the video message so it faced the window.</span><span class="p">The hologram of a middle-aged woman with green hair pulled back tightly popped up. Her face had the lines of hard living. That perception may have been influenced by my memory of our brief encounters with her. She was as tough as they come. I hit the play button.</span><span class="p">“Hey dickwad, how’d your regen go?” she said, dripping with sarcasm. “Hope you don’t mind that we took that Starlancer back. We found a lot of supplies in it – nice stuff, really. Thanks for stocking the ship so well. We’ll put it to good use. –Oh, one more thing: if we ever cross paths with you assholes again, we will stomp your shit so hard there won’t be any regenning after that. That’s a promise.” She just stared at the camera for a couple seconds, then it ended.</span><span class="p">“I gotta hand it to her: she’s good at being shitty,” Salty said.</span><span class="p">“Yup,” I said. “And as shitty as that makes me feel, there is a piece of good news there, right?”</span><span class="p">“Yeah, it sounds like they’re counting the score even now,” Zero said.</span><span class="p">“I’d prefer not to run into her again. I don’t think that was an idle threat.”</span><span class="p">“No, I think we should steer clear of Nine Tails in general for quite a while,” Salty said.</span><span class="p">“Yeah… So speaking of our future,” I said. “I have a plan.”</span><span class="p">“Oh shit,” Salty said, shaking his head. “Let me guess: you want to go begging Mendies for help?”</span><span class="p">“Well, not exactly.”</span><span class="p">“Oh seriously, Lucky?” Salty scowled. “You want to go to the leader of one of the biggest crime syndicates in five star systems for help?”</span><span class="p">“The guy likes us.”</span><span class="p">“Are you so sure?” Salty snapped. “We THINK he liked us last year when we helped him get his hands on some dangerous – and illegal – AI shit. But we still don’t know if it was really him behind the million-credit gift we got. We have no evidence! And even if he DOES like us, he’s still a fucking crime lord!”</span><span class="p">“Hey, we’re in a public place, you guys,” Zero said quietly.</span><span class="p">“Yeah, you’re right. You’re right.” Salty looked up at the ceiling and exhaled deeply. “I’m going to walk around a little. I’ll be back in 10,” Salty said as he walked off without looking at me.</span><span class="p">When he was out of earshot, I turned to Zero. “What do you think? Is it worth asking Mendies for a little loan or something?”</span><span class="p">Zero sighed and shook his head. “I don’t know. I mean, I think you’re right: all the signs say he was happy with us and gave us those credits. And Meeka’s friend in the Otoni syndicate did say he was happy with us.”</span><span class="p">“Right, and he helped us get Freight. That was a big deal.”</span><span class="p">“True. It’s just that he’s, basically, a really serious criminal. It’s kind of risky being associated with him.”</span><span class="p">“Yeah, but it’s not like we’re going to be joining his syndicate, you know?”</span><span class="p">“Not so sure. In the eyes of the UEE, any connection is a guilty connection.”</span><span class="p">I sighed. “Well, I don’t know. There are degrees of association, right?</span><span class="p">“From what I know of the UEE, there are, but it also depends on who would be dealing with us and the mood they’re in.”</span><span class="p">“Fair. I guess I’m just thinking if we took a loan from him, that’s not really a crime, right?</span><span class="p">“Usually.”</span><span class="p">“Plus, they’d have to catch us. And they’d have to care enough to bother with something minor like that.”</span><span class="p">“The odds are probably with us, but there are still a lot of risks associated with getting involved with being in debt to a criminal syndicate.”</span><span class="p">I nodded and shrugged. Zero turned and looked out across New Babbage’s frozen lake. I moved over beside him and looked out into the gently falling snow. A tram whizzed through the clear tunnels over the lake, toward the city. The sun was going down, and the orange glow on the snow-covered landscape was pretty gorgeous. The glowing colored lights on some of the city’s big buildings had started to come on.</span><span class="p">“So where did you grow up over there?”</span><span class="p">Zero didn’t reply for a couple beats. Then he lifted his hand and pointed to the left of the tallest building, still staring. “Over there. Big building with small apartments.”</span><span class="p">“OK, assholes, who’s hungry?”</span><span class="p">I turned around to see Salty licking a half-eaten ice cream cone and
